Bus:

  input:

    To be used with new keyword.

    The first parameter is the audio node that

    the output of the bus will be routed to.

  output/behavior:

    Returns a bus instance with an input property

    such that, whenever an audio node is connected

    to that input, the output of said node is routed

    through each audio node in the bus.

  methods:

    bus.getInput:

      input:

        No parameters.

      output:

        Returns the first node in the bus' node chain.

  example:

    var context = new AudioContext( );

    var osc = context.createOscillator( );

    osc.type = 'sine';

    osc.frequency.value = 440;

    var bus = new Bus( context.destination );

    osc.connect( bus.getInput( ) );

    osc.start( context.currentTime + 1 );

    osc.stop( context.currentTime + 2 );

Beat:

  input:

    The first parameter is a soundID that the beat will

    use to identify how to produce sounds on playback, the second

    parameter is the sequence that the beat belongs to.

    It is important for the beat to know what sequence it belongs

    to in order to reference the appropriate bus track on playback.

  output/behavior:

    Returns a beat instance with a beat.isOn getter function

    that indicates whether or not the beat is to be played on the

    next scheduling loop.

    Beat instances are not intended to be used anywhere other

    than in the sequencer in a context that has the property

    context._sampleBuffers which matches soundIDs to

    audio buffers.

  methods:

    isOn:

      input:

        This method does not take any parameters.

      output/behavior:

        Returns true if the beat should be played on the following scheduling loop.

        Returns false otherwise.

    toggle:

      input:

        This method does not take any parameters.

      output/behavior:

        Negates whatever boolean value is held by beat_.isOn.

    play:

      input:

        Takes one parameter that indicates the time, in seconds,

        relative to the context's coordinate system at which

        the appropriate sample should be schedules to start playing.

      output/behavior:

        Schedules the beat's sound for time when on the Web Audio

        API's run loop.

  example:

    var context = new AudioContext( );

    context._sampleBuffers = [];

    var buffer = context.createBuffer( 1, 44100, 44100);

    var channel = buffer.getChannelData( 0 );

    for( var i = 0; i < 44100; i++ ) {

      channel[ i ] = Math.sin( i*440*Math.PI*2 / 44100 );

    }

    context._sampleBuffers[ 'sine' ] = buffer;

    // Don't worry about sequencer now. This is just

    // an easy way to find a beat that is properly connected

    // to other nodes in the audio context.

    var sequencer = new Sequencer( 120, 4, ['sine'] );

    var beat = sequencer.getBeat( 0, 0 );

    // Expect the beat to be off

    if( beat.isOn( ) ) {

      beat.play( context.currentTime + 1 );

    }

    beat.toggle( );

    //Expect the beat to be on

    if( beat.isOn( ) ) {

      beat.play( context.currentTime + 2 );

    }

    //That is, sine wave should start playing in 2 seconds.

Sequence:

  input:

    The first parameter is the soundID that specifies the sound

    of the beats in the sequence, the second parameter is the number

    of ticks in the sequence (that is, how many beats there are for

    each loop of the sequence), and the third parameter is the

    sequence's bus track's input audio node. 

  output/behavior:

    Returns a sequence which is nothing but a collection of beats

    along with information about the routing of the output

    of each beat encapsulated in a track bus.

    Note that all of the beats that comprise the sequence

    play back the same sample. That is, beats in sequences

    are associated to each by the sound that they play.

    Like beats, sequences are intended to be used by

    sequencers, not elsewhere.

  methods:

    getSoundID:

      input:

        This method does not take any parameters.

      output/behavior:

        Returns the soundID of the sound being played by

        the beats in the sequence.

  example:

    var context = new AudioContext( );

    context._sampleBuffers = [];

    var buffer = context.createBuffer( 1, 44100, 44100);

    var channel = buffer.getChannelData( 0 );

    for( var i = 0; i < 44100; i++ ) {

      channel[ i ] = Math.sin( i*440*Math.PI*2 / 44100 );

    }

    context._sampleBuffers[ 'sine' ] = buffer;

    var sequencer = new Sequencer( 30, 4, ['sine'] );

    var sequence = sequencer.getSequence( 0 );

    // Just for the purpose of illustration,

    // this example accesses the _beats property of

    // sequence. However, this property is meant to

    // be hidden from anywhere other than the Sequencer

    // definition. Beats should be accessed through

    // the Sequencer.prototoype.getBeat method.

    sequence._beats[ 0 ].toggle( );

    sequence._beats[ 1 ].toggle( );

    sequence._beats[ 2 ].toggle( );

    sequence._beats[ 3 ].toggle( );

    sequencer.play( );

    // Should play a second long sine wave

    // every two seconds.

Sequencer:

  input:

    The first parameter is the sequencer's

    tempo as the number of beats played per minute,

    the second parameter is the number of ticks in

    each of the sequences of the sequencer, and

    the third parameter is an array of sound IDs. Each

    sound ID in the third parameter will be mapped to

    a new sequence with as many ticks as the second

    parameter.

  output/behavior:

    Returns a sequencer instace. Information about

    the instance should be retrieved using it's getter

    methods. Do not, for any means, mess with sequencer._lastBeatTime.

  methods:

    getTempo:

      input:

        This method does not take parameters.

      output/behavior:

        Returns the sequencer's tempo in beats per minute.

    getTickNumber:

      input:

        This method does not take parameters.

      output/behavior:

        Returns the number of beats in each of the

        sequencer's sequences.

    getSoundIDs:

      input:

        This method does not take parameters.

      output/behavior:

        Returns an array with one sound ID for

        each sequence in the sequencer.

    getSequence:

      input:

        The first parameter specifies the index

        of the targeted sequence.

      output:

        Returns the sequence at the sequence

        index specified by the first parameter.

    getBeat:

      input:

        The first parameter specifies the sequence's

        index, and the second parameter specifies

        the beat's index within that sequence.

      output:

        Returns a the beat instance at the coordinates

        specified by the parameters.

    toggleBeat:

      input:

        The first parameter specifies the sequence's

        index, and the second parameter specifies

        the beat's index within that sequence.

      output:

        Toggles the _isOn property of the beat

        found by getBeat for the same arguments.

    play:

      input:

        Takes in a callback function that will be

        called each time a new tick is scheduled.

        This callback function should handle

        one parameters that represents the time between

        the moment the callback is triggered and the moment

        at which the sound was scheduled.

        This is meant to be used along with setTimeout

        to coordinate UI behavior with the progression

        of the sequencer's music.

      output/behavior:

        Begins playing the sequences in the sequencers

        concurrently starting at beat 0.

    stop:

      input:

        This method does not take a parameter.

      output/behavior:

        Stops the playback of the sequences and

        returns track header to beat 0.

    scheduleTicks:

      input:

        The first parameter of this function is the same

        callback function as is passed in to the play function.

      output/behavior:

        This is where the groove's scheduled. It uses a combination

        of setTimeout and beat.play in order to schedule musical

        events precisely but not too far ahead in time. This is

        meant to reduce lag between user interaction and musical

        response.

    save:

      input:

        This method does not take a parameter.

      output/behavior:

        Returns the JSON stringified version of

        an object that can be used by Sequencer.prototype.retrieve

        to reconstruct the sequencer state that this method is called

        upon.

    retrieve:

      input:

        This method takes in a string produced

        by sequencer.save.

      output/behavior:

        Returns a sequencer that is identical to the

        sequencer on which sequencer.save was invoked

        to produce the string that is passed in as the first

        argument.

    match:

      input:

        A sequencer instance.

      output/behavior:

        Deeply compares this and the sequencer instance

        passed in as an argument and returns true if and only

        if both instances have the same tempo, the same number of

        ticks, the same sound IDs and the same _isOn state on

        each corresponding beat.

  example:

    var context = new AudioContext( );

    context._sampleBuffers = [];

    var buffer440 = context.createBuffer( 1, 44100, 44100);

    var channel440 = buffer440.getChannelData( 0 );

    for( var i = 0; i < 44100; i++ ) {

      channel440[ i ] = Math.sin( i*440*Math.PI*2 / 44100 );

    }

    context._sampleBuffers[ 'sine440' ] = buffer440;

    var buffer880 = context.createBuffer( 1, 44100, 44100);

    var channel880 = buffer880.getChannelData( 0 );

    for( var i = 0; i < 44100; i++ ) {

      channel880[ i ] = Math.sin( i*880*Math.PI*2 / 44100 );

    }

    context._sampleBuffers[ 'sine880' ] = buffer880;

    var buffer220 = context.createBuffer( 1, 44100, 44100);

    var channel220 = buffer220.getChannelData( 0 );

    for( var i = 0; i < 44100; i++ ) {

      channel220[ i ] = Math.sin( i*220*Math.PI*2 / 44100 );

    }

    context._sampleBuffers[ 'sine220' ] = buffer220;

    var sequencer = new Sequencer( 60, 4, ['sine220', 'sine440', 'sine880' ] );

    sequencer.toggleBeat( 0, 0 );

    sequencer.toggleBeat( 1, 1 );

    sequencer.toggleBeat( 2, 2 );

    sequencer.toggleBeat( 1, 3 );

    sequencer.play( );

    var copy = Sequencer.prototype.retrieve( sequencer.save( ) );

    console.log( sequencer.match( copy ) ); //-> true
